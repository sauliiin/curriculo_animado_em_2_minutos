            <p>I always have projects in progress and some that never finish 🙃, because I'm always adding features to <a href="https://github.com/sauliiin/BetterFlix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BetterFlix</a>, integrating APIs for reviews, trailers and ratings. I even discovered that I like and I'm good at front-end 😅!</p>
            <p>This playground <a href="https://github.com/sauliiin/Managing-vacation-and-hybrid-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Managing-vacation-and-hybrid-work</a> has so many features and is so useful that the other day I went to add an employee through the code and realized the site already had that feature in its interface 🫠!</p>
            <p>My passion for technology doesn't end with code; I like to modify hardware, optimize all the systems I use, and create automations from Android, Windows, Alexa.</p>
            <p><strong>Artificial intelligence can support the work, but creativity is essentially human — and it is curiosity, combined with practice, that feeds it. I'm driven by curiosity, always aim to deliver my best and believe there is always something new to learn. My passion for programming logic and challenges drives me to always go further.</strong></p>
